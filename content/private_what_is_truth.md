title: Why Establishing Common Ground for Truth is Essential
---
There is a Quote by Philosopher Karl Popper "I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth." This is true, but it fails to mentioned what that "effort" is.. First Effort both parties must put efforts to have a common ground on "how do they know what truth is" then they can put efforts and refute each other and get closer to the truth. ...

Explaining involves Explainer and Explainee. Both must have a common understanding what good explanations are. In absence of that explanations are useless. We must learn to intervene without explanations or different explanations.
