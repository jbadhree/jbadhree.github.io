I recently came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It is an analogous comparison of  `growing knowledge` to `growing` plants and trees in a `garden` and its `digital` because these ideas are published in the `world wide web`. Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. Later in life, I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and came to an understanding that all knowledge, by nature, grows. I do not anticipate to change the course of human knowledge or make a huge dent or anything like that, I would just like to humbly contribute my part. 

I get ideas to think about because I see problems and I `try` to understand them and then solve or dissolve them. I also think about things in a systemic and a holistic way, to an extent that matters to understanding and solving the problem. I am a software engineer by profession (my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/)) so my ideas and solutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology, but I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. I am not planning to organize these thoughts in any specific fashion, but I will hyperlink them where ever possible so they are linked. 

I also have an attitude of `refutation`. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas, especially the most deeply rooted ones, because I want to get closer to the truth of reality by eliminating errors in our knowledge. This attitude usually creates a situation where there are [unpopular opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularkpopopinions/comments/wki1fq/what_is_an_unpopular_opinion/). While I try to refute deeply rooted ideas, I aware that I am fallible. So I may be wrong, you may be right, if you want to get closer to reality as well, and want to discuss about any of my thoughts posted in this site, feel free to email me @ [badhree.babu.314@gmail.com](mailto:badhree.babu.314@gmail.com) or start a conversation in this public [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/badhrees-garden).

I may be wrong, you may be right, and by an effort we may get nearer to the truth.
