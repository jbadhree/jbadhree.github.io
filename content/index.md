I recently came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It is an analogous comparison of  `growing knowledge` to `growing` plants and trees in a `garden` and its `digital` because these ideas are published in the `world wide web`. Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. Later in life, I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)and came to an understanding that all knowledge, by nature, grows. I do not anticipate to change the course of human knowledge or make a huge dent or anything like that, I would just like to humbly contribute my part. 

I get ideas to think about because I see problems and I `try to` solve (or dissolve) them and I do not always succeed. But I look at things in a systemic and a holistic way. I am a software engineer by profession (my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/)) so my ideas and solutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology, but I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. I am also not planning to organize these thoughts in any specific fashion, but I will hyperlink them where ever possible.  

I also have an attitude of refutation. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas, especially the most deeply rooted ones, because I want to get closer to the truth of reality. This attitude usually creates a situation where there are [unpopular opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularkpopopinions/comments/wki1fq/what_is_an_unpopular_opinion/). While I refute existing deeply rooted ideas, I am aware that I am fallible. So I may be wrong, you may be right, if you want to get closer to reality as well, and want to discuss on any of my posts in this site, feel free to email me @ [badhree.babu.314@gmail.com](mailto:badhree.babu.314@gmail.com) or start a conversation in this public [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/badhrees-garden)as well.
