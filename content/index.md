I recently came across the team [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It is an analogy to write down ideas and `grow` them like growing a garden. I liked the idea that ideas can keep growing until they die and some ideas may never die. Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. Later in life, I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)and understood that that knowledge by nature grows and that knowledge is infinite and humanity has just began this [infinite journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity). 

I see problems everywhere and I aim to solve or dis-solve some of them. Some problems are technical some are social. Most of them are techno-social. I am a software engineer by profession (my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/)) so most of the problems I solve may gravitate around software. But I am not going to limit my learnings to just software or engineering. 

If you have any questions feel free to email me @ `jbadhree@gmail.com`.
