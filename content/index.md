I recently came across the team [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It is an analogy that compares `ideas` to `growing` plants and trees in a `garden` and its `digital` because its a part of the `world wide web`. I liked the idea that ideas can keep growing until they die and some ideas may never die. Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. Later in life, I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)and understood that that knowledge, by nature grows or evolves and that knowledge is infinite and humanity has just began this [infinite journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity). Ideas are part of this ever growing knowledge (human or not) and this is my humble contribution towards it. 

I get ideas because I see problems and I `try to` solve (or dissolve) them. I do so in a systemic and a holistic way. I am a software engineer by profession (my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/)) so my ideas and solutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology, but I will try to eliminate the bias as much as I can. 

I noticed that tend to refute existing ideas, especially the most deeply rooted ones, because I want to get closer to the truth of reality. This attitude usually creates a situation where there are [unpopular opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularkpopopinions/comments/wki1fq/what_is_an_unpopular_opinion/). While I refute existing deeply rooted ideas, I am aware that I am fallible too. So I may be wrong, you may be right, if you want to get closer to reality as well, and want to discuss on any of my posts in this site, feel free to email me @ [badhree.babu.314@gmail.com](mailto:badhree.babu.314@gmail.com) or start a conversation in this public [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/badhrees-garden)as well.
