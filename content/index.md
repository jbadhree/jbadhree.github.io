**I know Nothing. Everything written in this ~~site~~ garden could be wrong.** 

I wanted to created a website for myself and blogging seems to be more prominent way to build a personal website in this day and age. One day came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It sounded more like `public notes`  rather than `personal blog`. It resonated well with me and I thought to create one. This is a tiny space in the www where I can write my ideas down and keep modifying them, or as Digital Gardners say - keep growing them. 

In my school days, I had an naïve idea that knowledge about any subject is never complete and there is always room to learn more. May be I thought so because the education system has been structured with a syllabus that builds on top of each topic every year. Later in life I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and learnt something profound. [All Human Knowledge,  are basically some Ideas that evolves and grows.](human_knowledge.md) I aim to use this garden to write my ideas down and grow them and I believe this will deepen and widen my understanding about the truth of reality. 

I am grateful that I got to meet one of the greatest `theacher` [Manish Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishjain99/) who lives up to a quote from Socrates "I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think", and hence a `theacher` and not a teacher. His `theachings` helped me clear my thoughts and look at reality in a way I never looked at before. Thanks You Manish!

I sometimes predict that some events will happen and consider them as [problems](problem.md) and start thinking about them in a systemic and a holistic way to first understand and then to dissolve or solve them. These problems are going to one of the primary focus in this digital garden. I do not claim to have the best solutions/dissolutions or even have one, but I believe writing these down will help me improve my understanding and I will be able to find better dissolutions or solutions for the problems.

I am a software engineer by profession so the problems I pick, the ideas I come up with and my dissolutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology. I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. 

I am planning to grow this garden with an attitude of `refutation`. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas, especially the most deeply rooted ones. I do so, because, I want to get closer to the truth of reality by eliminating errors in my understanding. While I try to refute existing deeply rooted ideas, I am aware that I am `fallible`. So I may be wrong, and I am eager to find where I am wrong. So, my ideas are open for refutation as well. I encourage readers to `point out errors` (via the comments section) about any of my thoughts posted in this garden. If not for errors, I encourage readers to simply start a discussion in case I am not clear about anything. I think discussions and conversations are at the crux of human knowledge. 

Ability to comment needs a GitHub account ([Signup](https://github.com/signup) for free) powered by [giscus](https://giscus.app/). Also feel free to start a conversation in any other public forum (preferably [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/),[X](https://x.com/jbadhree) ) and tag me to it.
