I recently came across the team `digital garden`. I think it is an analogy to write down an ideas and grow them like we would grow plants in a garden. This would be my garden where I think and grow ideas. 

I see problems everywhere and I strive to solve some. I am a software engineer by profession and I currently work for PayPal. I am Indian by origin and currently live in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.
