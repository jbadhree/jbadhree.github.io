**About this ~~site~~ garden**

I wanted a way to freely write my ideas and get feedback from people. Blogging seems to be more prominent way to do that in this day and age. And then one day came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It sounded more like `public notes`  rather than `personal blog`. It resonated well with me and I thought to create one. This is a tiny space in the www where I can write my ideas down and keep modifying them, or as Digital Gardners say - keep growing them. 

In my school days, I had an naïve idea that knowledge about any subject will never be complete and there will always be something to learn more. May be I thought so because the education system has been structured that way where a wide variety of subjects are introduced first and then they make us move towards a specialization and ultimately to very specific field of study in college and then work in the industry. But even after that, it seems there is so much to learn even in the area of expertise. Later in life I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and learnt something profound. [All Human Knowledge,  are basically some Ideas that evolves and grows](human_knowledge.md) forever.  I aim to use this garden to write my ideas humble down and grow them and I believe this will slightly deepen and widen my understanding about the truth of reality. 

I am grateful that I got to meet one of the greatest `theacher` [Manish Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishjain99/) who lives up to a quote from Socrates "I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think", and hence a `theacher` and not a teacher. His `theachings` helped me clear my thoughts and look at reality in a way I never looked at before. Thanks You Manish!

I sometimes predict that some events will happen and consider them as [problems](problem.md) and start thinking about them in a systemic and a holistic way to first understand and then to dissolve or solve them. These problems are going to one of the primary focus in this digital garden. I do not claim to have the best solutions/dissolutions or even have one, but I believe writing these down will help me improve my understanding and I will be able to find better dissolutions or solutions for the problems.

I am a software engineer by profession so the problems I pick, the ideas I come up with and my dissolutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology. I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. 

I am planning to grow this garden with an attitude of `refutation`. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas, including mine. I do so, because, I want to get closer to the truth of reality by eliminating errors in my understanding. While I try to refute existing ideas, I am aware that I am `fallible`. So I may be wrong, and I am eager to know where I am wrong. I encourage readers to `point out errors`  in any of my ideas posted in this garden via the comments section in each post. If not for errors, I encourage readers to simply start a discussion in case there is a question or I am not clear about anything. I think discussions and conversations are at the crux of human knowledge.
