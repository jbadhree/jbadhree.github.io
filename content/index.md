I know Nothing. Everything written in this garden could be wrong. 

One day came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). It sounded more like public notes rather than personal blog. I wanted to created a website for myself and public notes resonated more with me than a blog. So this is a space in the internet where I can write down my ideas and keep modifying them, or as Digital Gardners say - keep growing them. 

Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. May be I thought so because education system has been structured with syllabus that builds on top of each topic every year. Later in life I read about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and learnt something profound. [All Human Knowledge,  are basically some Ideas that evolves and grows.](human_knowledge.md) I aim to use this garden to write my ideas down and grow them and I believe this will deepen and widen my understanding about the truth of reality. 

I am grateful that I got to meet one of the greatest `theacher` [Manish Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishjain99/) who lives up to a quote from Socrates "I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think", and hence a `theacher` and not a teacher. His `theachings` helped me clear my thoughts and look at reality in a way I never looked at before. Thanks You Manish!

I sometimes predict that some events will happen and consider them as [problems](problem.md) and start thinking about them in a systemic and a holistic way to first understand and then to dissolve or solve them. These problems are going to one of the primary focus in this digital garden. I do not claim to have the best solutions/dissolutions or even have one, but I believe writing these down will help me improve my understanding and I will be able to find better dissolutions or solutions for the problems.

I am a software engineer by profession so the problems I pick, the ideas I come up with and my dissolutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology, but I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. I am not planning to organize these thoughts in any specific fashion, but I will hyperlink them where ever possible so they are linked. 

I am planning to grow this garden with an attitude of `refutation`. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas, especially the most deeply rooted ones. I do so, because I want to get closer to the truth of reality by eliminating errors in our knowledge. While I try to refute existing deeply rooted ideas, I am aware that I am `fallible`. So I may be wrong, and I am eager to find where I am wrong. So if you want point out errors or discuss about any of my thoughts posted in this garden, feel free to email me @ [badhree.babu.314@gmail.com](mailto:badhree.babu.314@gmail.com) or start a conversation in any public forum - (preferably [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/),[X](https://x.com/jbadhree) ). 

My ideas are open for refutation as well. Whenever I get refuted, by someone else or by myself, and I change my position in any topic I write, I will make sure I highlight in someway like ~~strikethrough~~. The more I ~~strikethrough~~  the more I learn, and more happy I am that I learnt. 

"I may be wrong, you may be right, and by an effort we may get nearer to the truth."
