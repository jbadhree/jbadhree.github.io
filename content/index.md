title: Welcome to My Garden

I came across the term [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) and I wanted to `selfishly` create one. Since my school days, I have always felt my knowledge about any topic is never complete and there is always room to learn more. Later in life I got in to philosophy and I learnt [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) and came to an understanding that human knowledge is not static it changes, evolves and grows. I aim to use this garden to write my ideas down and grow them and I believe this will deepen and widen my understanding about the truth of reality. 

I see some events happening and consider them as [problems](problem.md) and start thinking about them in a systemic and a holistic way to first understand and then to dissolve or solve them. These problems are going to one of the primary focus in this digital garden. I do not claim to have the best solutions/dissolutions or even have one, but I believe writing these down will help me improve my understanding and I will be able to find better dissolutions or solutions for the problems.

I am a software engineer by profession (my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbadhree/)) so the problems I pick, the ideas I come up with and my dissolutions may have a [familiarity bias](https://www.thebehavioralscientist.com/glossary/familiarity-bias)  towards engineering and technology, but I will try to eliminate bias as much as I can. I am not planning to organize these thoughts in any specific fashion, but I will hyperlink them where ever possible so they are linked. 

I am planning to grow this garden with an attitude of `refutation`. Meaning, I will try to refute existing ideas and solutions, especially the most deeply rooted ones. I do so, because I want to get closer to the truth of reality by eliminating errors in our knowledge. This attitude usually creates a situation where there are [unpopular opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularkpopopinions/comments/wki1fq/what_is_an_unpopular_opinion/) and I am not afraid to have one. I strive to provide better explanations over winning friends.

While I try to refute deeply rooted ideas, I aware that I am fallible. So I may be wrong, you may be right, if you want to get closer to reality as well, and want to discuss about any of my thoughts posted in this site, feel free to email me @ [badhree.babu.314@gmail.com](mailto:badhree.babu.314@gmail.com) or start a conversation in this public [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/badhrees-garden).

I may be wrong, you may be right, and by an effort we may get nearer to the truth.
