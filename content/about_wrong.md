title: Multi-Dimensional Meaning of the word - Wrong
---
I wanted to communicate to people reading my ~~website~~ garden that I am "fallible" and I was "Epistemically Humble". So in the home page, I wrote "Everything written in this ~~site~~ garden could be wrong". I felt happy that I was being clear. But then when I was reading it again after a few days, I felt, the word “wrong” is a versatile concept with layers of meaning that can vary depending on the context. So I thought understanding these different dimensions can help me communicate more clearly. 

My primary focus when I discuss something being “wrong” leans toward **logical, functional, and empirical** wrongness. 

**The Core Dimensions of “Wrong” on This ~~website~~ Garden**

**Logical Wrongness**

Logical wrongness is about errors in reasoning, structure, or factual accuracy. This dimension of “wrong” occurs when something doesn’t make logical sense or violates rules of logic. 

For instance:

• If a solution to a problem contains faulty reasoning or doesn’t align with logical principles, it’s logically wrong.
• A process with a structural inconsistency that leads to unreliable outcomes also falls into this category.

**Functional Wrongness**

Functional wrongness describes something that doesn’t work as intended or fails to achieve its purpose. This is especially relevant in technical fields, engineering, and product design. Functional wrongness focuses on usability and performance—whether something fulfills its role effectively or not.

Examples include:

• A tool that doesn’t perform its intended function has something functionally wrong with it.
• A website feature that doesn’t respond correctly or leads to errors is also an example of functional wrongness.

**Empirical Wrongness**

Empirical wrongness is grounded in observation and evidence, often in the context of scientific or factual claims. Something is empirically wrong if it contradicts observed reality or established evidence. This type of wrongness is crucial for maintaining accuracy in science, data analysis, and empirical research.

For example:

• A statement that goes against documented evidence or experimental results is empirically wrong.
• A conclusion that isn’t supported by reliable data or research falls into this category as well.

**Other dimensions of Wrong which I stay away from include**

**Morally Wrong**

Moral wrongness relates to ethics, values, and the impact of actions on people or society. When we say something is morally wrong, we’re usually making a judgment based on its potential harm, fairness, or alignment with societal values. This dimension of “wrong” is more subjective and can differ widely based on personal beliefs and cultural standards.

**Culturally Wrong**

Cultural wrongness refers to actions or behaviors that deviate from societal norms or traditions. This can vary widely across different cultures and often doesn’t carry a moral or logical implication. It’s about whether actions fit within the expectations of a particular community or tradition.

**Aesthetic Wrongness**

Aesthetic wrongness is based on taste and perception, dealing with things that might seem out of place, unpleasant, or jarring to the senses. This dimension is highly subjective and doesn’t imply any deeper error beyond personal or collective preference.

**Emotional Wrongness**

Emotional wrongness occurs when something feels inappropriate, uncomfortable, or unsettling on a personal level. This might involve tone, timing, or choice of words that, while not factually incorrect, create discomfort or feel “off” emotionally.

**Legal Wrongness**

Legal wrongness refers to actions that violate established laws or regulations. It’s a straightforward concept but can vary depending on the region or legal system in question. Legal wrongness carries specific consequences, like fines or penalties, but it doesn’t always align with moral or logical wrongness.

**Linguistic Wrongness**

Linguistic wrongness involves the incorrect use of language, which may hinder understanding or disrupt clear communication. This dimension is particularly relevant in writing, translation, and grammar, where clarity is essential.

I hope this gives some not only gives perspective about the word wrong, but also the subjective nature of communication. As Karl Popper puts it - "It is impossible to speak in a _way_ that _you cannot_ be _misunderstood_" I hope this helps clarify misunderstandings of any about the word "wrong".
