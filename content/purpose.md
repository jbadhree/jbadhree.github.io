title: On Purpose - It's Not What You Say. It’s What You Do
---
Purpose is not about making grand statements—it's revealed through consistent actions. While it’s tempting to define purpose through slogans or motivational speeches, what truly matters is how closely your actions reflect your declared purpose. The same applies to organizations and individuals, but the key is in how they align, despite potentially having different driving purposes.

**Organizational Purpose vs. Individual Purpose**

Organizations often define their purpose broadly, such as "creating sustainable products" or "improving lives through technology." This organizational purpose should guide every decision and action taken within the company. However, individual employees within the organization may have personal purposes that are different—perhaps to grow their careers, improve their skills, or make a positive impact in their field. These individual purposes don’t have to match the organization's exactly, but they should align.

When both the organization and its people act in ways that benefit one another, powerful synergy is created. Employees are motivated to contribute to the organizational mission, and the organization, in turn, supports the personal growth and goals of its employees. This alignment is essential for long-term success.

If an organization claims to value sustainability but pursues profit at the expense of the environment, or if an individual professes to prioritize integrity but makes unethical decisions, misalignment erodes trust and effectiveness. The closer the alignment between stated purpose and actions, the more authentic and impactful both individuals and organizations become.

**Purpose vs. Goals**

It’s important to distinguish between purpose and goals. Purpose is your guiding principle—your “why.” It’s what drives you or your organization in the long term. Goals, on the other hand, are specific steps you take to stay aligned with that purpose. Goals are measurable, concrete, and often have deadlines, but they serve the larger purpose.

For example, if your purpose is to help people live healthier lives, a goal might be to launch a wellness program in your company. Goals are fluid and adaptable, while purpose remains steady. Without goals, your purpose risks becoming just another vague idea. But without purpose, your goals may feel directionless and disconnected.

**Purpose Can Evolve**

One final thought: purpose isn’t static. As we grow, our purpose may change, and that’s okay. What matters is that your actions consistently align with your current purpose. Whether personal or organizational, as long as actions reflect a true commitment to your stated purpose, you are on the right path.

Purpose is not about what you say—it’s about how you live it. As long as your actions align with your evolving sense of purpose, you are truly living with intent and integrity.
