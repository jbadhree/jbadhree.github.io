I was recently talking to my niece who is in High School, and is taking AP classes. I asked if I can take a look at one of her AP books. She handed me AP World History Book.

What was the reason for which this AP course was created before a growing number of students took it ? At some point in history a growing number of people believed that watch was flat or earth was the center of universe. But few people believed otherwise. Who is right ?

Independent work, research and analysis is good. But right after that they mention, "covering a lot of materials in short time". So they again scare students with the amount of material and short time to add pressure. What is important for students, to gain knowledge or to merely cover the materials ? 

Then they scare you saying
