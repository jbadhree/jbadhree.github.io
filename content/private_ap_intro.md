title: High School AP
---
I was recently ran in to an AP (Advanced Placement) book and read the introduction page. I later read about the [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Placement)of AP to learn its purpose on why it was created. As I was reading, it observed how the education system in the US is screwed up. Wikipedia mentioned a "report" - `In 1952 they issued the report _General Education in School and College: A Committee Report which recommended allowing high school seniors to study college-level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work`. I tried to find this report and its seems be not available online. So basically today no one knows why AP courses started in the first place. Who is going to re-evaluate the need for AP and the role it plays. 

talking to my niece who is in High School, and is taking AP classes. I asked if I can take a look at one of her AP books. She handed me AP World History Book. I turned to the first page which said "Introduction" and as I was reading it, I saw a lot of things that I didn't agree with. Especially the reasons they stated for why its good for students should take an AP class. It was more about the outcome oriented and less about the means. It also felt like a marketing content towards a career path that gravitates around scholarship, money and "good" colleges.

It starts with a warning about how hard its going to be - "....challenging and demanding.... already have a lot of pressure...". Then it talks about the reasons why should one do it despite it being so difficult. The reason starts with an authority "....Growing number of students..". If its so wonderful, why use authority of 'count' to give a reason for students to take it ? 

Then it says the students who take AP "..realize benefits". So where is the real reason ? What was the reason for which this AP course was created before a growing number of students took it ? 

At some point in history a growing number of people believed that earth was flat or earth was the center of universe. But few people believed otherwise. Who is right ? Why is this book indirectly telling students to follow the crowd. If humanity gave reasoning based on what growing number of people are doing or believing, would we have made any progress? 

Next it talks about "Independent work, research and analysis" which is good. But right after that they mention, "covering a lot of materials in short time". So they again scare students with the amount of material and short time to add pressure. What is important for students, to gain knowledge or to merely cover the materials ? 

And then they say college admission officers "value" AP  courses. So if they think like this - "This student has taken AP and scored well, so let me admit them in the college", if their decision making process is so `objective`, why is a human needed for admissions. It can be automated system which looks at certain pointers and says admitted or not. Shouldn't the admission officers make a `subjective` judgement based on what the student has to say in the Essay. In this day and age of LLMs, shouldn't they conduct interviews to admit students in ? 

It says ".. are able to handle a challenge". Here again they indirectly convey that college education is gonna be challenging.
