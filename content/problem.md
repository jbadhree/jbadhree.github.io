title: What is a Problem
---
Typically, we view problems as someone's interpretation of an unexpected past event. But framing problems this way is unproductive for two key reasons:

1. It's already happened — The event is in the past, and we can't change it.
2. It's subjective — Often, it’s just an opinion, either from an individual or a group, and that limited perspective may not offer real solutions.

But what if it's more than just an opinion? What if a thorough postmortem was conducted, and we know exactly why the event happened? Can we use this information to prevent similar events in the future? The answer: possible, but not probable.

There’s a famous quote by Mark Twain that resonates with me:

`History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.`
— Mark Twain

The point here is that future events are influenced by a myriad of random variations, making it unreliable to base our solutions solely on past occurrences.

**A New Way of Seeing Problems**

Instead of looking backward, I propose we view problems as `predicted future events—events` that are open to being refuted or validated. This approach reframes problems as hypotheses: ideas that can be tested, argued, and ultimately confirmed or disproved as the future unfolds.

But there's more. After diving into David Deutsch's works, I discovered an essential criterion for a meaningful explanation: it must be hard to vary. When an explanation is hard to change, it becomes systemic and holistic. It’s no longer just one person’s opinion—it’s an idea that holds strong across various contexts, making it more reliable.

**Defining the Problem**

To define a problem, I’ve established a few key principles. A problem must be:

- Hard to Vary — It shouldn’t be easily manipulated to fit just any situation.
- Refutable — It should be possible to challenge the explanation or prediction.
- Validatable — The event or explanation can be tested and confirmed.
- A Predicted Future Event — The problem isn't rooted in the past but in what we anticipate may happen.

But there's one final element: desire. Do we want this event to happen? If the answer is yes, then it’s not a problem at all. But if the event is `undesired`, then we have a true problem.

**The Full Definition**

In summary, here’s how I define a problem:

`An Undesired, Hard to Vary, Refutable, Validatable, Predicted Future Event.`

By approaching problems this way, we shift from reactive thinking to proactive problem-solving, grounded in systemic understanding and a focus on future possibilities.
