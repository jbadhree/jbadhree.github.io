title: What is a Problem
---
Usually a problem is `someone's` thought about an `unexpected past event`. Viewing problem like this does not allow us to solve it, because, 1. It has already happened and 2. It is just an opinion from one (or a bunch). It is not useful. 

One could argue what if it is not just an opinion, but someone did a postmortem and found for why it happened, we can use this information to prevent it from happening in the future. Is it useful then ? Possible but not Probable. There is this quote that captures my thought:
```
History does not repeaat, but it often rhymes. 

Mark Twain
```
There are too many random variations that can happen in future so just using the information for why something happened in the past may not help to solve the problem in the future. 

So, Can we see problem as a `predicted future event` based on theories which can be `refuted` by argumentation right now and `validated` in future ? Yes, this is `mostly` how I like to view problems - `Refute-able, Validate-able, Predicted Future Event`

Along which this, I would like to add one more criteria. it is `Hard to Vary`. I added this criterion after I read David Deutsch's works. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eEffbjzNwE)  where he explains why an explanations must be hard to vary. Hard to Vary also makes the theories and explanations Systemic and Holistic, so its not just someone's opinion, its most likely to happen. 

So we have definition of a Problem as a `Hard to Vary, Refute-able, Validate-able, Predicted Future Event`. But, there is one last piece that I would like to add. Its our desire. Do we want that event to happen, If Yes, then there is no problem. But if its `undesired` then we have a problem. 

So this is how I define a problem - `Undesired, Hard to Vary, Refute-able, Validate-able, Predicted Future Event`.
