## **Investment Philosophy**

- **Value Investing**: I believe in value investing. I look for companies that are undervalued and have a strong business model. I look for companies that have a competitive advantage and are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. I believe that the market is not always efficient and that there are opportunities to find undervalued companies.

- **Long Term Investing**: I am a long term investor. I believe in holding onto investments for the long term. I believe that the market is unpredictable in the short term and that it is difficult to time the market. I believe that the best way to invest is to buy and hold onto investments for the long term.

- **Diversification**: I believe in diversification. I believe that it is important to have a diversified portfolio in order to reduce risk. I believe that diversification is important because it helps to spread risk across different investments. I believe that diversification is important because it helps to reduce the impact of any one investment on the overall portfolio.
